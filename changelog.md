Changed getPagination() to return array containing only previous and next page numbers.

This method needs the data but also the total number of records, the limit ($top) and the offset ($skip)

```php 
$limit = 5;
$skip  = request('next', 0);

$messageQueryParams = [
	"\$orderby" => "displayName",
	"\$count"   => "true",
	"\$skip"    => $skip,
	"\$top"     => $limit,
];

$contacts = MsGraph::get('me/contacts?'.http_build_query($messageQueryParams));
$total    = $contacts['@odata.count'] ?? 0;

$response = MsGraph::getPagination($contacts, $total, $limit, $skip);
$previous = $response['previous'];
$next     = $response['next'];
```

The in a view the previous and next links can be displayed:

```php 
@if (request('next') > 0)
	<a href='{{ url()->current().'?next='.$previous }}'>Previous Page</a>
@endif

@if ($next != 0)
	<a href='{{ url()->current().'?next='.$next }}'>Next Page</a>
@endif
```
